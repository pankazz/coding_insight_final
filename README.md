I used Python 2.7.9 and used sys, datetime and time libraries.

I have tried to implement all the features without using exotic libraries available for data analysis. 

Also for the test cases ip and resources had extra line in the end but hours didn't so I formatted my code accordingly. There's a chance you might get a conflight because of this adjustment but the results would be same.
